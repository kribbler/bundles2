<strong>Spirulina</strong> is a spiral coil shaped, blue-green, micro algae (0.2 - 0.3mm in size), which grows naturally in some alkaline lakes, in both tropical and subtropical climates around the world.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Spirulina has evolved over the past 3.6 billion years on Earth. </strong></li>
	<li>Scientists say that microorganisms like Spirulina generated our oxygen.</li>
	<li><strong>Spirulina has been harvested and consumed for centuries by local populations.</strong></li>
	<li>Spirulina was a food source for the Aztecs as late as the 16th century.</li>
	<li><strong>Spirulina may have an even longer history in Chad (Africa), dating back to the 9th century.
</strong></li>
</ul>
Spirulina is currently in daily use regionally and used to make broths for meals. It is harvested from small lakes and ponds around Lake Chad and then dried into cakes called dihé, which are sold in local markets.

Although Spirulina has always been consumed regionally, it has only gained a wider, more popular worldwide appeal, recently. In 1974, Spirulina was declared by the United Nations World Food Conference as the "best food for the future", and is now consumed by health conscious people all over the world.
<h1>Benefits of Spirulina?</h1>
Scientific studies - <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed" target="_blank">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed</a> - have shown <strong>Spirulina to have many health benefits</strong>. Spirulina is a perfect food supplement, containing high concentrations of antioxidants like beta-carotene, vitamins, enhanced Iron bioavailability, trace elements, minerals, the rare essential fatty acid GLA, and more. It has a balanced spectrum of amino acids, (including essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the human body), cleansing chlorophyll, and its blue pigment (phycocyanin) is a powerful antioxidant.

<strong>Up until now, the available Spirulina products (pellets) were not attractive or tasty.</strong> Spirulina cultivation for tablets is often produced in open ponds in China, Thailand, India, Japan, and Hawaii. The lack of traceability of the product is problematic; as there are many issues with using an open pond method because cultures are highly vulnerable to contamination.
