2013.02.25 - version 2.0.6
MAJOR FEATURE UPGRADE!
* Feature: All plugin code updated to be 100% compatible with WooCommerce version 2.0 and backwards.
* Feature: Removed Compare pop-up fly out powered by Fancybox and Lightbox tools and replaced with Product Comparisons opening in a new browser window. WooCommerce Version 2.0 uses the new WordPress PrettyPhoto as the pop-up tool and in testing we found supporting 3 pop-up scripts, PrettyPhoto, Fancybox and Lightbox was very buggy and troublesome. So we have removed all 3 pop-up scripts and replaced with open in browser window. The result is around 4,000 less lines of code in the plugin and a beautifully robust comaparison result presentation.
* Feature: Added 2 show Comparison in new widow options. Option 1. Show the product Comparison in an on-screen pop-up window or Option 2. Show Comparisons in a new window.
* Feature: Added Fixed Features Title column. This means when more than 3 products are being compared in the pop up window or on-page comparison the products scroll left under the Features Title column - this means the user always can see what product features are being compared, beacuse the are fixed while the products and each feature values scroll under them.
* Feature: Added Comparison Table scrolls horizontal and vertical via the window scrollers and not by scrollers on an inner container. This is a great UI enhancement as it does away with inner containers - no more having to use the window scrollers to get to the inner container scroll bars which was confusing and messy.
* Feature: Completely reworked the Print Product Comparison function. The Print function now works beautifully with added print style. Prints the entire tall of 3 products Comparison columns regardless of the tall of the columns.

2013.01.08 - version 2.0.5
* Feature: Added support for Chinese Characters
* Tweak: UI tweak - changed the order of the admin panel tabs so that the most used Features tab is moved to first tab.

2012.12.14 - version 2.0.3
* Fixed: Updated depreciated custom database collator $wpdb->supports_collation() with new WP3.5 function $wpdb->has_cap( 'collation' ).  Supports backward version compatibility.

* Fixed: Fixed conflict with WordPress Domain Mapping plugin - thanks to Johannes for access to his WPMU install to find and fix this issue.
* Fixed : Updated depreciated php function ereg() with stristr() so that auto plugin auto upgrade feature work without error for WordPress 3.4.0 and later
* Fixed: Change Pro Version plugin API call so that it only calls from the WP-Plugins page and not from every admin page.
* Fixed: Changed Pro Version plugin API call so that if it calls once to the API and it does not connect it auto aborts instead of keeping on trying to call.
